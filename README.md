Considering the given data set we laid out some basic research questions as well as their summary on how to maximize on different terms.

•	Which genres are the most popular in each region? Are certain genres universally popular or favoured especially in certain parts of the world?
1.	Across all regions, the most popular genres are Action, Platform and Shooting games.
This is consistent with both the European and North American region with the exception of Japan as roleplaying games are dominant in its sales.
2.	Europe
In Europe, the Action Genre tops the sales of 99.62 million, representing 19.5% of total sales.

•	How have gaming trends changed over time? What do the trends say about the future of gaming?
1.	The number of popular games grew exponentially over the last two decades, peaking in 2010-11
This rapid increase is probably because of the democratisation of technology, increasing individuals’ access to gaming consoles and hence the volume of games purchased.
2.	In recent years, fewer releases have entered the Top 200 video games list
The marked drop in Top 200 games released in recent years may be due to a broader shift away from video games, as new technologies such as mobile games and VR have begun to decrease the market for video games. This trend is likely to continue as such technologies become more prominent and accessible.
It may also be possible that because these games have been released more recently, there is a smaller window for gaming purchases, hence decreasing the likelihood of a game being one of the Top 200 most purchased games of all time.
3.	The prevalence of the Sports, Shooter and Action genres has grown noticeably over the past three decades
There is a notable trend towards more action-oriented genres such as Shooting, Racing, Action and Sports in the last 15 years.
Popular games released prior to 2000 are predominantly platform or puzzle-based yet in recent years, these genres appear to be some of the least popular.
This may be due to the advent of mass media and growing interest in racing, sports and action.

•	What Strategies You Can Do in Order to Increase Profits?

•	For the states of Europe, North America and Other Countries have similarities, namely Genre Sport and Action which contribute to sales, but some games that are sold a little different. The manager can make a decision in the form of trying to cross-promote the sale of games, an example of the most popular games in Europe to try to promote in America.
•	For Japan, the genre is slightly different from the others, the most popular genre of Role Playing. Therefore, it can be tried to keep promoting games categorized as Role Playing and also selling new games from publishers which the genre is Role Playing .
